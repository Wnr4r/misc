#!/bin/bash
sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" "$@"

#work around to make mvn work with sudo command
# -E tells sudo to preserve the environment.
# env "PATH=$PATH" is expanded outside the sudo call, making the external PATH available inside the sudo too (this is required in addition to the -E as the PATH usually receives special treatment in addition to the treatment the entire environment receives).
# "$@" passes the arguments our script receives to the sudo line.
# Save this in a file (can be called mysudo) in a directory in the PATH (u can do export path and choose a dir), give it +x permissions, et voil√†. e.g /usr/bin
